			<h3>Data Quality and Overview</h3>

			The dataset used for this analysis contains information about all residential sales transactions in the Metro Boston region between 2000-2023.
			The fields include information about seller, buyer, price, location, and more. There appears to be 63 total columns with each column having
			different styles of data encoded, such as binary 0/1 with fields like buyer_bnk_ind (buyer is a bank), buyer_gov_ind(buyer is a government entity), etc.
			These are indicator variables for the existence of some 0 or 1 category. There are other numerical fields like the price of the transaction sale.
			We must be careful about each column and the given range of the values in addition to understanding what null means. For example, a null value
			in the price field represents a mortage transaction. The first step of the analysis thus is to determine the overall data quality and
			what's contained in it before proceeding with the analysis.

				To start our data analysis, it is important to get a sense of what data is missing or may not be complete. After browsing the different
				fields of the dataset, I noticed that most of the major fields and columns like the indicator variables, average price, property type, etc.
				all had similar counts of records, meaning there wasn't a lot of variation in terms of some critical column having too many null values. This
				made more sense since many of the fields were indicator variables that had to be either 0 or 1 and other numerical values could be 0 instead of
				null, which means there is meaning here. After browsing, I did notice some columns had many null values and wanted to investigate. Figure 1
				shows 7 columns that has a lot of missing values in the form of null. To create this figure, I had to create some advanced pivot columns and
				values and separate out the fields via a calculated field of null status based on the pivot columns. In the end, we can see various columns
				sorted by decreasing null-values. We notice that the month horizon field has more than 30,000 null values. This column represents the flip horizon
				field in months and is represented by a character like 24+. There aren't too many unique values in the flip horizon columns overall, thus this number of
				null values in the month horizon may be higher than normal. At any level, I think this is still a high number of null values, thus there is some
				complexity in having columns that relate to each other. Other fields like price difference and price difference percentage also has quite a
				high number of null values. This is likely due to the fact that many of the transactions may not be flips, so the price difference between flips
				may not be a meaningful statistic. It is possible that a property only had 1 transaction, thus there is no notion of conseuctive transactions
				to conduct an analysis for these fields. Other columns may be more niche and not apply to each transaction, thus has a decent number of null values
				like the last sale deed filing date or number of single-family residence purchases attached to the buyer. Overall, there does exist many fields with
				high null values, but overall the critical fields seem to have meaningful information. There is lack of various information, thus caution will be
				needed for analysis.

			<figure>
				<img src="Counts.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				After looking at null values for various fields, I was curious about the different values that actually do exist, thus asked a follow up
				question of what is the breath of the ranges for various fields in the dataset? In other words, do many values repeat in the columns or
				is it all varied? This is what this figure is answering by taking 4 fields and getting the distinct counts of the values in each of these
				columns. There was some advanced data transformation to try to find diverse set of column values, such as not having all the columns be indicator
				columns. In addition, there was an issue of what distinct means in each case as some cases of empty spaces made it so that two entities that
				were actually the same were not being treated as the same due to extra whitespace, etc. that were accidentall introduced when browsing the data.
				The figure shows that the answer to my question is that there is a diverse set of columns where some have only a few values that repeat a lot while others
				contain extremely unique values. For instance, address and the locations of the residences across the dataset seem to be different and unique while
				an indicator column for whether a transaction was a cash transaction or not only had 2 unique values. As a sanity check, there were 23 unique
				values for the year column, which makes sense as the range for the data was from roughly 2000 to 2023, thus we have data for the years in the
				correct range. The distinct values for the number of bathrooms was a shock to me as it showed 13 unique values, which seems high for the number
				of bathrooms in a house. I investigated this by looking at the dataset and found out that there were high values like 11, etc. for the number of
				bathrooms. Hypothesizing that this was due to the property type, I found instances of records where there were family-style luxurious mansions
				that contained high number of bathrooms. I also realized that I have been to and seen some of these mansions that are outliers, such as the
				former mansion of the Governor of Massachusetts, which is a fraternity at MIT now on Hereford Street. All of this helps contextualize the dataset
				and connect it to reality.

				<img src="Time and Zip Code.png" width="1000" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Being inspired from the high number of bathrooms and luxurious mansions dilemma, I decided to investigate how many transactions
				occurred in what zip codes over the 20 plus years of data that exists to see if the transactions are all over the place or seems
				to be concentrated. The figure has the zip codes on the left size and the years across the top. The intersection of these two axes
				tell the number of transactions that occurred in that zip code in that year. The darker colors reprsent more transactions, thus revealing
				the insight that a few zip codes take the prize of having many transactions, some being consistent across the time period as well. For instance,
				it seems like the 02116 zipcode has had a high number of transactions throughout the time period. This led me to ask a followup of what makes
				this zipcode unique. After some research, I realized that this is one of the areas that is included in Boston's extremely luxurious Beacon Hill
				neighborhood. This can explain the high prices of homes in that area today since flipping the homes and speculation of these homes can lead
				to high number of transactions with each transaction essentially raising the price of the home. This is certainly problematic for the average
				resident of the city as they can't afford higher prices of homes as entire neighborhoods seem to be victims of speculation and lack of affordable housing.

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What makes a property a prime target for investors' speculation investment strategy?</li>
					<i>Motivation:</i> A main question that came into my mind was what makes a certain property more appealing for people
					to throw everything at trying to invest in it and make profits? Given the limited amount of homes overall, is There
					something that we can do to make homes overall less likely to be a victim of speculation without ruining the quality
					of the homes? This is mainly from my experience of looking at homes and wondering why one home next to another home
					is just so much more expensive for seemingly no reason. I also have traveled around the different neighborhoods of Boston and
					there are sometimes copy cat homes with different prices. The Homes for Profit MAPC article talked about a "housing submarket",
					a collection of neighborhoods—some next to each other, some not—with similar housing stock and housing market characteristics.
					This motivated me to wonder if there are other factors that fuels this speculative investment and if that can be avoided by removing these
					factors to create less speculative investment and more affordable housing?
				<li>How have luxury high-rises evolved over time?</li>
				<i>Motivation:</i> The Boston Globe article on Boston's Towers of Wealth was quite illumniating as I have seen first-hand the
				rise of these massive skyscrapers and high-rises, especially in areas like Seaport which have extremely high home prices. The Boston
				Globe article mentioned a double edged sword of these high-rises creating more jobs for the city with the expense of affordable housing.
				There seems to be more high-rises that are being built and planned, such as Echelon Seaport and the South Station Tower, that I have seen
				posters for in-person, thus the motivation for understanding how expensive high-rises have become and how they can fit into an already
				bustling-city is there for me. Investigating the previous question about what makes a property a prime target also led me to question
				how much appeal a high-rise has for speculation.
				<li>How profitable are short-term vs. long-term flips?</li>
				<i>Motivation:</i> I was interested in whether there are incentives for wealthy investors to invest for a long time or short time as
				shorter investment could lead to more turnover of properties, which can often lead to higher prices due to more transactions. On the other hand,
				it may be more profitable for investors to hold on to the property for a long time, but that may lead to more homes that are not occupied purely
				because the investors want to make more money. Therefore, the motivation for this question is based on investigating the time of flips and whether
				that can inform us something about the problem of speculation.
				<li>How has mortgage usage evolved over time across different investor types?</li>
				<i>Motivation:</i> Given the history of the 2008 Recession and the economic downturn because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was motivated
				to learn about how transactions with mortage have changed throughout the time period. In addition, there have been many changes to interest rates
				mortages in the housing space over time. Personally, my family bought a house in 2016 with a mortage transaction and there have been an increase
				in mortage costs overall, thus was curious as to how speculation and investors may be causing harm to average residents. This question can also
				hint at how many investors deal with cash-only transactions and if that may be contributing to housing issues.

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="Investors Usage of Property.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				To start out with understanding what about a property makes it a prime candidate for this death trap of speculative investment leading to
				higher prices of homes and less affordable housing, I was curious about how the type of the housing and what it's used for contributes to
				speculation. To this effect, this graphic showcases the usage types of various different properties that an LLC bought. In other words, the larger
				bubbles tells us that there were more properties of that particular usage that an LLC bought over the entire time period. The insight that
				the figure tells us is that condomoniums seemed to be a pretty high usage of properties that an LLC bought. This seems to suggest that various
				LLCs like to do speculation on properties that can return high profits due to the number of people living in it. Many condos can enable many
				people to live in it, which can mean that investing in these properties can result in more people being part of the transactions. This is true as
				the usage type of many properties is also 4-8 and 9 unit apartments, which also involve many people. This seems to be a double edged sword
				as this atleast allows many people to have housing, but it also screws over many people. LLCs could just leave many condos alone, but that may mean
				the quality and ability to live in these condos may not be that great. Perhaps the LLCs can diversify what they invest in to allow as many people
				to have a place to live. If many people share the intense high costs of condos and apartments, there may be an opportunity to make housing a reality
				for more people. There are other factors that may affect what properties are prime targets for speculative investment than just the usage.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Distribution of Properties.png" width="1050" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				A follow up question that resulted from looking at what makes a property a target for speculation was just how diverse and accessible
				the properties are in addition to their usage. From the previous visualization, we saw that many properties that contain many people like
				condos and apartments tend to be invested in. The question then becomes why is housing not affordable if we have many people sharing cost. It
				seems like the higher number of transactions that occur for these condos and apartments along with just the environment that the properties are located in
				contributes to more speuclation for these properties. This figure showcases the different properties that are part of the transactions in the dataset with
				their zipcode. The different colors indicate different zip codes with each dot representing a property that an LLC bought. There was some data processing to
				get some prominent zip codes as there are some zip codes that did not contain many relevent properties and were outliers to the general trend being
				seen in the map. In addition, filtering the buyer being an LLC was done to match the subsample to the one from the previous visualization to understanding
				what makes a property more likely to be a victim of speculation. As can be seen, it appears that the properties are all over the city in different zip codes
				with a few clear observations. Many of these properties that are invested are in the most prominent, central, and quite well-off neighborhoods of the city.
				From my own experience of going around Boston, I see that there are not many properties in neighborhoods like Roxbury or Dorchester (zip code like 02125, etc.).
				These areas are not seen as prime targets due to their lower incomes, less schooling, and not as developed. I had a follow up question here
				of whether there are good transportation networks near the homes that are prime targets and those are not prime targets for speculation.
				After looking at visualizations of the T network, I noticed that some of the neighborhoods on the outskirts do not have good rail networks
				going through it, which can lead to lower development of the area. This can be compared with the well-off areas where there is large speculation in
				areas like Beacon Hill, Back Bay, North End, etc. These areas are more wealthy and have a relatively high cost of living, thus it is hard for properties
				here to be that affordable despite the fact that many properties may be condos or apartments that have many people living in it. The idea
				that can be explored for more affordable housing overall may be for speculation of homes to be more spread out and not be concentrated in only a few areas.

			<figure>
				<img src="High Rises Cost.png" width="1000" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				 A follow up question from the previous visualization that I wanted to investigate was how high-rises compare with standard properties in terms of if they
				 are also prime targets for speculative investment. Given that location and the type of property affected speculation, I was curious about whether
				 high-rises have also suffered in their affordableness due to various factors. One aspect that I wanted to study first was how much spending was being
				 done on high-rises and how that has evolved over time. This visualization shows the average price of a high rise over the time period. I had to do
				 some data processing to first filter down the style of properties to just be high rises. After some investigation, I realized that there were issues with keeping
				 the entire time period since the price of high-rises seemed to be off for the COVID-19 years as the entire contruction and housing industry was disrupted.
				 This led to flawed interpretations that did not seem to resemble reality, thus I subsampled the time period for the year built for the propety to cut off to mid 2010s before the major changes
				 would appear. This still allowed an interpretation of the Great Recession. As the visualization shows, the price of high-rises has overall increased a lot
				 since the 1900s. Various economic events causes a spike or decrease in the prices, such a recession in the early 1990s and of course the Great Recession of 2008.
				 These price changes matched the reality of the world. With this information, it seems like speculative investment is still related to high-rises as an average
				 resident would not find these high-rises to be quite affordable.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="High Rises Purpose and Price.png" width="1000" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				As a follow up to the previous visualization, I was interested in what caused the prices of high-rises and multi-use properties to increase overall and what about the
				properties is contributing to this increase in prices and lack of affordability. To investigate this, I created a visualization that showcases the different
				usages of properties and the average price of all the properties that have that usage. The darker and bigger squares represent a larger average price while
				the number on a particular square represent the usage of the properties in a usecode format. To create this visualization, some data processing
				was required to make the information make sense, such as avoiding outliers in the data for the year built for the property that would be the very early years
				and the overall COVID-19 pandemic era, thus the time period for year built matches the previous visualization to cut off in the mid 2010s.
				The visualization showcases that the properties, including high-rises, are costly due to a specific list of usage, such as having a department store, bank, or hotel in the property.
				This is very plausible as these are often very common in high-rise buildings. Adding a separate filter for the style of the properties to be just
				high-rises showcases a visualization that really only shows the usage of MXU RES+COM, which means that high-rises specifically are being used for a mix of
				residential and commerical reasons. All of this overall suggests that high-rises are becoming even more mixed-use and the prices overall are increasing
				significantly, thus it seems like speculative investment is high and will get higher for high-rises in the future. This will be in conjunction with more
				commercial usage of high-rises, such as department stores, banks, etc. which will essentially turn the high-rises into the environment of luxurious
				neighborhoods of the city like Beacon Hill.

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Flip Terms Profits.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				After looking at high-rises and their increasing cost, a follow up to ask would be how profitable they are overall. After some research, it seems like their
				mixed usage of commercial and residential elements can make them profitable. Comparing this to all properties and seeing what makes them profitable is a follow up
				to investigate in this visualization via the lens of flip terms. A flip term is essentially the amount of time it takes for a property to be bought and then flipped for profits.
				The time between the buying and the selling is essentially a flip term. The visualization shows the average price segmented by flip terms to determine how much a home
				is worth based on the flip term, thus revealing how profitable a flip term could be. As the visualization shows, it seems like having a long flip
				term is most profitable. This seems to make sense since an investor could buy a property, renovate/fix the property up, and wait a while before selling it for
				a much higher price, thus gaining lots of profits. The downside for average residents due to this longer flip time is that no one is living in the house
				during the flip term, thus furthering the problem of a lack of affordable housing since there is not enough houses where a resident can live. Perhaps
				there should be an effort to reduce the flip term to a short flip term, which would see the second-most profitable scenario. This also makes sense since
				the investor would not have to spend money on maintenance, renovation, etc. as much and instead can sell the house very quickly for a higher price and make profits.
				This is still not ideal as the price of homes is still quite high, but better than having no one live in the house. A reasonable (and not exorbitant)  profit for an investor
				would also make a big difference.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Mortage Transactions Over Time.png" width="1000" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Investing in a house and then selling it for profits on a different time period can be beneficial or harmful depending on other conditions of the economy. To investigate this as a
				follow up to the flip term profitability investigation, I created this visualization that aims to track mortage transactions over time divided by the different
				types of investors. This can reveal information about the state of the economy and intensity of the profits. The figure showcases the percentage of transactions that are
				mortage-based in a given year. To create the figure, some data processing for determining if a transaction is mortage-based or not via a custom calculated field
				needed to be done in addition to adding segmentation for various investor types. The visualization shows that there is a wide diversity in the trends
				for mortage transactions for different investor types. For instance, we can see that some institutional and large investors tend to have a lot of mortage-based
				transactions as they likely work with many individuals and properties. However, this changes based on the status of the economy.  We can see that non-investors like average residents tend to have a lot of mortage-based
				transactions since they do not have the financial means to just outright buy a house with all of the money, including cash. Many of the smaller
				investors have some cash that can be used for transactions. All of the different investor types had a downward trend of mortage-based transactions during
				turbulent economic times like the 2008 Recession. Many mortage transactions picked up during the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic although the effects of that
				period is still evolving.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

		<figure>
				<img src="Changes Over Time.png" width="1000" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The changes in the percentage of mortage transactions led me to a follow up of connecting the mortage transactions to state of economy to
					the overall changes in the price difference of properties, which may be fueled by other factors like the rate of flips happening. With more flips happening,
					there are more transactions of which many could be mortage-related as the prices of the homes are likely increasing as well. To this effect, this
					visualization showcases the average buy side and sell side slips in terms of whether the transaction is a buy/sell flip or not. This is coupled with the
					change in the price difference between the flips over time. The insight gained from this visualization is that there was a big period of many flips during the 2010s that contributed to
					higher pricing for homes and more mortage-based transactions, especially by larger and institutional investors. Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic and the changes in the economy
					led to lower trends for all of the properties mentioned, revealing that a lot of issues in housing tend to be linked to the overall economy.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>This data exploration via visualizations touched on various different topics like pricing of properties, usage of properties, flips, mortages, changes over time, etc.
				The anaylsis started out with an overview of the data and its quality. Overall, the dataset is quite rich with more than 60 columns ranging from
				numerical values like price with related columns for price difference and price difference in percentage, and indicator columns that are binary values
				to represent whether the transaction has a property like a government buyer or not. There were many columns that had null values or 0s that had
				meaning for the most part, but many pieces of information were incomplete as it was likely hard to gather detailed information on all of the
				properties in the dataset over the 20 plus year period like amenities. This dataset focused on the city of Boston and had some zip codes represent a lot of
				information as compared to other zip codes. The analysis began with an investigation of what makes a propety susceptible to speculation. As it turns out,
				the type of property and what it is being used for along with the physical location/environment the property is located in dictates a lot whether
				it will be invested in or not. In particular, the analysis focused on high-rises and saw that their increased mixed usage of residential and commerical
				elements will make them more likely to be targets for investment in the future as there are many individuals and businesses to real the profits from. Both regular properties
				and high-rises have grown in prices over time to really high numbers. Part of the reason for this is that the number of flips for a property seem to be
				rising over time. This means that an investor buys a property and immediately sells it for higher price really soon. On the other hand, some investors
				like to make even more profits by keeping the property and maybe doing some work on it for a while before selling it for an even higher price. This causes a big issue
				of a propety being vacant, which reduces the supply of livable properties and thus causes a higher demand and higher home prices. Due to this increased costs,
				there may be more transactions that are mortage-based for non-investors who need to have a place to stay. However, some investors like to just work with cash and invest in properties
				as soon as they can to make profits. All of these insights lead to the ultimate insight of the fact that speculation overall increases the price of all properties and that
				city of Boston is becoming even more elusive for average residents trying to find a livable place as the rich areas are becoming more rich and there isn't a lot of sign
				to suggest that investors will forgo their profits for the sake of affordable housing anytime soon.
